Hi to all,

This Product service project is to see what I can build with React. It includes a single page with 7 different sections and a navigation bar. Within it, I use the React useState concept to create the responsive effect of clicking a three-icon button that opens into a side webpage menu.
More features to be added to this webpage.

Thank you for your time
